Rebuilt my Code Academy first assignment marketplace app using ReactJS and NodeJS. 

In one of our assignments at Coder Academy we had to build a two sided marketplace using Ruby On Rails.

I enjoyed the challenge and thought an interesting way to build on my ReactJS and NodeJS knowledge would be to attempt and rebuild this but using ReactJS for the client and NodeJs for the server side.

I got the application to a working state however ran into some issues with Stripe Integration.
